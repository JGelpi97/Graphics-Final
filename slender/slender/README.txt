The goal of the game is to collect all of the snowballs(8), and not get killed by Slender.
He is constantly moving towards you but you cannot always see him. He gets faster the more snowballs
you collect. You should be running as much as you can.
You do get tired and have to wait before you can run more. The player can collide with everything.
Slender will not spawn in buildings or trees but behind them. If he gets too close you die.
There is a kill animation where you look towards him that works probably like 75% of the time.

There are textures on everything(Walls/Trees/Slender/Snowballs/Floor). The texture files are snow.tga,
wall.tga, and tree.tga. They should be in whatever path the rest of the files are in.
